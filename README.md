## Computer Vision Homework: Image Classification and Image Segmentation

Welcome to the **Computer Vision Homework** repository!

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a homework assignment focused on two fundamental computer vision challenges: image classification and image segmentation. The assignment is divided into two parts:

### Part 1: Image Classification

In the first part of the assignment, we work on image classification tasks using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our primary objective is to classify images from the CIFAR 100 dataset. The CIFAR 100 dataset is conveniently available as a Keras resource and consists of 100 distinct classes, with each class containing 600 images.

### Part 2: Image Segmentation

The second part of the assignment delves into image segmentation. Our task here is to extract and segment objects from images using the PASCAL VOC-2012 dataset. While the PASCAL VOC-2012 dataset contains 20 different classes, we have chosen to focus on the foreground vs. background segmentation to facilitate the learning process.
